Your spacecraft's on-board computer detected a fault in the landing automation during a regular system check.
He told you on the display: Take control of the landing maneuver - system fault! Use the engine lever to control the engine.

I was inspired by computer CGS (computer game system) from CZ magazine ABC. It was a paper computer for learning basic programing.
